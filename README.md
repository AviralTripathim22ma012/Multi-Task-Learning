Welcome to the Multi-Task Learning for Attribute Prediction project repository! This project explores the application of multi-task learning (MTL) in attribute prediction tasks using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

In machine learning, attribute prediction involves predicting one or more attributes or characteristics of an object or entity based on its features or relevant data. This project employs the concept of multi-task learning, where a single model is trained to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously.

## Project Details

- **Technique**: Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
- **Objective**: Attribute Prediction
- **Methodology**: Using a neural network with shared feature extraction layers and task-specific output layers
- **Benefits**: 
  - Enables the model to learn common representations across several tasks
  - Potentially improves performance and reduces training times compared to separate models for each task

## Implementation

The project implements a neural network architecture with shared feature extraction layers and separate output layers for each attribute being predicted. During training, a loss function that considers the errors for each task is utilized to simultaneously optimize the parameters of all output layers.
